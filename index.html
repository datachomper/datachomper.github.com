		<h2>asterisk</h2>
		<p>By day, I write linux drivers for <a href="http://digium.com">Digium</a> and the <a href="http://asterisk.org">Asterisk</a> project. According to my <a href="https://issues.asterisk.org/svnstats/dahdi/linux/trunk/user_rmeyerriecks.html">stats</a>, I focus mostly on the digital cards (T1/E1), but I've been known to stray occasionally. Chances are pretty high that a few of your phone calls have traversed our hardware. You can find me on the asterisk-dev mailing list if you need any help with DAHDI.</p>

		<h2>aviation</h2>
		<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/18734645">Goofing off</a> with the plane and the new GoPro camera I got for christmas.</p>

		<h2>nfl spread predictor</h2>
		<p>One of my more recent hobbies is data mining for interesting connections. I'm not a gambler, but when I learned how the nfl "spread" system works I had the idea that I could build an algorithm to predict the spreads for each week's matchup. In order to build this algorithm, I built a <a href="http://github.com/datachomper/predict">simulation engine</a> which I can then write various prediction algorithms against and pit them against one another to see which is the best. I'm currently waiting to see how it does against the 2010 season.</p>
		<p>The toughest part about mining sports data is finding the data to begin with. I wrote <a href="/aaron/">this script</a> to scrape a few scores/lines from various website and export it into a format that you can copy/paste into an excel sheet. The line listed is the most current Vegas line, it's based off the home team.

		<h2>one-hour game</h2>
		<p>My buddy always says that creativity stems from constraints, so one time I tried to see how much of a game I could create in <a href="/skymaster/">one hour</a>. I actually got much further than expected. Pre-existing sprites are plentiful and the &lt;canvas&gt; tag is so easy to work with. There's no collision detection, so you're on the honor system if you hit an asteroid.</p>

		<h2>dokuwiki woot plugin</h2>
		<p>Startups are notorious for quick-and-dirty code with no comments. While this is great in the beginning, it doesn't scale very well. When I was a project manager for <a href="http://spoofcard.com">spoofcard.com</a> I needed to encourage the employees to adopt the new wiki so I wrote a <a href="http://dokuwiki.org/plugin:woot">woot plugin for dokuwiki</a> to drive daily page views.</p>
	
		<h2>fuelMonster</h2>
		<p>I love to fly, so I <a href="http://github.com/datachomper/fuelmonster">wrote this chrome extension</a> to mashup <a href="http://navmonster.com">navmonster.com</a> and <a href="http://100ll.com">100ll.com</a>. So now whenever you plan a flight, it goes and scrapes fuel prices for every airport near your flightpath allowing you to shop for cheapest avgas.</p>

		<h2>autotune</h2>
		<p>I'm currently <a href="http://github.com/datachomper/autotune">trying to work out</a> how the "autotune" algorithm works, so I can eventually write an asterisk module for autotuning phone conversations. The math is killing me, though.</p>
		
		<h2>pythonchallenge.com</h2>
		<p>My <a href="http://github.com/datachomper/pythonchallenge.com">solutions</a> for the <a href="http://pythonchallenge.com">pythonchallenge.com</a> series of puzzles. Probably the most fun I've ever had with programming.</p>
